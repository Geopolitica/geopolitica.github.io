  title: "About Geopolitica"
  text1: "Geopolitica was founded to bring online data to the center of political research. Online activity is influencing life in democracies more than ever before, yet political research methods are still largely characterized by time-consuming retrospective analyses of offline sources."
  text2: "Geopolitica seeks to change this by developing data-driven applications that apply algorithms in real-time, resulting in data that greatly illuminates geopolitical events as they happen and trains machine learning algorithms to predict their future impact."
  text3: "By looking to the future instead of the past, Geopolitica hopes to bring us closer to understanding global politics in a post-2016 world."
